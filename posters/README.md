# Posters

The ownCloud posters can be downloaded here. Everyone is welcome to print material and present ownCloud at events â€“ permission is not needed, everyone can help in the community!


## Variations

There are four posters, two targeting potential ownCloud users and two for potential ownCloud contributors or (third-party) app developers. If you attend an event, bring some of both but more of the ones targeting the audience you expect!

The four posters include a poster with a *safe* (using ownCloud means you can protect your data!) and the *Sync outside the box* poster for users; and the *create-instead-of-just-consuming* and *there is an app for that - you built it* posters to promote contributing to ownCloud.

The *Sync outside the box*  and *create-instead-of-just-consuming* posters have a variation with a white area you can write on to direct people to your booth or to present a list of talks they should attend.


## Printing

All posters are in ownCloud style white text on ownCloud-blue which you can print at a site like [onlineprinters.com](http://www.onlineprinters.com/) in larger quantities. To not empty the blue ink in an inkjet or laser printer for smaller quantities, we also have 'inverted' versions with black text on a white background.

Each poster is also provided with 1 mm bleed and with 1/8" bleed.

Last but not least, we provide the indd Indesign source files.

If you plan on presenting ownCloud at an event, find tips and info on [owncloud.org/events](http://owncloud.org/events).

Thanks for spreading the word on ownCloud!
