# Promo

ownCloud promotion material like logos, sticker templates, flyers and talk decks. Everyone is welcome to print material and present ownCloud at events – permission is not needed, everyone can help in the community!



## Logo

![](ownCloud logo square.png)

The logo is white on dark blue (#1d2d42). It should not be used differently, especially not inversed. The text can be optionally left out though.



## Sticker

![](ownCloud sticker A8.jpg)

Stickers are outdoor foil, DIN A8 (52x74 mm). We always order through [Flyeralarm (German)](http://www.flyeralarm.com/de/shop/configurator/index/id/34/aufkleber-outdoor.html#159=582&160=583&161=615&162=585) and usually get a batch of 2500 for around 35 €.
These stickers seem to get damaged over time though, so if you know a better printer please let us know.



## Shirt

Shirts are navy blue with simple white logo print centered on the chest. The model is EarthPositive EP03 slim-fit, we ordered through [Black Star Cotton (German)](http://www.cotton.de/hersteller/earthpositive/ep03-mens-slim-fit-shirt/) and the shirts are really good. Regarding size distribution, we ordered 50 consisting of: 6 S, 16 M, 17 L, 8 XL, 3 XXL – which turned out well. Shirts and print combined cost about 7 € per shirt. Just make sure to use the high-resolution ```ownCloud shirt logo.png```.



## Presentation

This presentation is a good start but a bit old. It was done in 2011 and first held at [RMLL Strasbourg](http://2011.rmll.info/Presenting-ownCloud), and again at [PHP Usergroup Stuttgart (German)](http://www.phpugs.de/archives/161-Treffen-04.2012,-Vortrag-Vorstellung-des-Projektes-ownCloud.html). It would need to be updated, especially the screenshots.
