# Flyers

The ownCloud flyers can be downloaded here. Everyone is welcome to print material and present ownCloud at events â€“ permission is not needed, everyone can help in the community!


## Variations

There are two flyers, one to inform users about ownCloud and one to inform potential ownCloud contributors or (third-party) app developers. If you attend an event, bring some of both but more of the ones targeting the audience you expect!


## Printing

Both flyers are in ownCloud style white text on ownCloud-blue which you can print at a site like [onlineprinters.com](http://www.onlineprinters.com/) in larger quantities. To not empty the blue ink in an inkjet or laser printer for smaller quantities, we also have 'inverted' versions with black text on a white background.

Each flyer is also provided with 1 mm bleed and with 1/8" bleed.

Last but not least, we provide the indd Indesign source files.

If you plan on presenting ownCloud at an event, find tips and info on [owncloud.org/events](http://owncloud.org/events).

Thanks for spreading the word on ownCloud!
